# 🐍 Python for Beginners – 6 Session Learning Plan

Welcome to this **interactive Python learning series** designed for absolute beginners.  
By the end of this 6-session journey, you'll not only understand the core concepts of Python,  
but you'll also build mini-projects using what you’ve learned — completely from the console! 💻

## ✅ Session 1: Introduction to Python

### Topics Covered:
- What is Python and why it's popular
- Variables and data types (int, float, string, bool)
- String manipulation (`.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.replace()`, slicing)
- Mini Project: **Bio Card Generator**

### 📁 Folder:
`/session1_intro/`

### 🧪 Project:
> `bio_card.py` – Ask user for name, age, hobby, and generate a formatted bio using string methods.

---

## ✅ Session 2: Collections – Lists & Tuples

### Topics Covered:
- Creating and modifying lists
- List methods: `append()`, `remove()`, `sort()`, `count()`, etc.
- Creating and using tuples
- Tuple vs List: Use cases and differences
- Mini Project: **Course Registration Console App**

### 📁 Folder:
`/session2_collections/`

### 🧪 Project:
> `course_registration.py` – Take user details and register them for one or more courses.  
> Uses: `input()`, string formatting, tuples for personal info, and lists for courses.

## 🔜 Session 3: Dictionaries & JSON

### Topics Planned:
- Key-value pairs
- Accessing and modifying dictionary data
- Working with real-world structured data
- Reading/writing JSON files

---

## 🔜 Session 4: Logic & Loops

### Topics Planned:
- If, elif, else conditions
- `for` and `while` loops
- Building basic menu systems

---

## 🔜 Session 5: Functions

### Topics Planned:
- Creating and using custom functions
- Built-in functions overview
- Code reusability and modularity

---

## 🔜 Session 6: Final Project

🎯 **Goal:** Combine all learned concepts to build a console-based student management system or a simple CLI app.
