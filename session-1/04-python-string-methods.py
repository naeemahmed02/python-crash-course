In 2017, researchers at Google published a paper that proposed a novel neural network
architecture for sequence modeling. Dubbed the Transformer, this architecture outperformed
recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on machine translation tasks, both in terms of translation
quality and training cost.
In parallel, an effective transfer learning method called ULMFiT showed that training long
short-term memory (LSTM) networks on a very large and diverse corpus could produce state
of-the-art text classifiers with little labeled data.
These advances were the catalysts for two of todayâ€™s most well-known transformers: the
Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (BERT). By combining the Transformer architecture with unsupervised learning,
these models removed the need to train task-specific architectures from scratch and broke
almost every benchmark in NLP by a significant margin. Since the release of GPT and BERT, a
zoo of transformer models has emerged; a timeline of the most prominent entries is shown in
